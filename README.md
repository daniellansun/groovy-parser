The new parser(Parrot) can parse Groovy source code and construct the related AST, which is almost identical to the one generated by the old parser(except the corrected node position, e.g. line, column of node). Parrot has been contributed to Apache Groovy. You can find it at parrot branch of apache/groovy.

Currently almost all features of Groovy are available. In addition, the following new features have been added:

* do-while loop(DONE)
* new operators: identity operators(`===`, `!==`), elvis assignment(i.e. `?=`), `!in`, `!instanceof`(DONE)
* lambda expression(DONE)
* method reference and constructor reference(DONE)
* try-with-resources(DONE)
* safe index(e.g. nullableVar?[1, 2])(DONE)
* groovydoc attached to AST node as metadata(DONE)
* etc.

**(Notice: All available features are executable)**

If you want to give it a try, make sure your machine have `JDK 8+` installed first, then follow the steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/danielsun1106/groovy-parser.git
$ cd groovy-parser
$ ./gradlew groovyConsole
```
